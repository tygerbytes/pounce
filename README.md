# Pounce!

Pounce is a fast and responsive [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme. See a real life example at [Uterpret.com](https://www.uterpret.com).

## Using Pounce with your site

### Installation

Assuming you're project it under Git source control, and you're in your base project directory, run this command:

``` bash
git submodule add https://github.com/tygerbytes/pounce.git themes/pounce
```

### Updates

Update the theme by issuing this Git command inside your project directory:

``` bash
git submodule update --remote --rebase
```

### Configuration

(Coming soon... üòè I still need to add an example site to this repo.)

## Credits

* I started this project using [Pulp theme](https://github.com/koirand/pulp), but it quickly morphed into its own thing. Thank you Koirand for getting me started.
